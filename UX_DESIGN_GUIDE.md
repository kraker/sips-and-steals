# UI/UX Design Guide

## Core Design Philosophy

**Target User**: The Discerning Urban Explorer seeking premium happy hour experiences through smart, context-aware discovery tools.

**Design Principle**: "Tight and focused on usability" - prioritizing immediate utility over visual complexity.

## Proven Design Patterns (LoDo Dashboard)

### 1. Mobile-First Architecture
**What Works**:
- Responsive grid layout that adapts seamlessly to mobile viewports
- Touch-friendly interface optimized for on-the-go decision making
- Vertical card layout maximizes screen real estate on mobile devices
- Single-column design prevents horizontal scrolling issues

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Design for 320px minimum width (iPhone SE)
- Ensure all interactive elements are minimum 44px touch targets
- Use vertical stacking for primary content flow
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools

### 2. Status-Driven Filtering System
**What Works**:
- Time-aware context buttons ("Open Now", "Starting Soon", "Closed")
- Real-time status detection provides immediate relevance
- Clear visual hierarchy separates current from future opportunities
- Reduces cognitive load by surfacing most relevant results first

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Status buttons should be prominent and easily accessible
- Use color coding consistently (green=active, orange=soon, gray=inactive)
- Always default to showing most immediately relevant content
- Provide clear visual feedback for active filters

### 3. Information-Dense Card Design
**What Works**:
- "Slick and just enough information but not too much"
- Essential data hierarchy: Name → Status → Price → Location
- Concise price guide format ($$-$$$) provides quick value assessment
- Average food and drink prices give concrete expectations

**Card Content Priority**:
1. **Restaurant name** - Primary identifier
2. **Current status** - Immediate relevance
3. **Price indicators** - Value assessment (avg food/drink prices)
4. **Location context** - Distance/neighborhood
5. **Quick actions** - Directions, reservations, website

**Design Constraints**:
- Maximum 6 lines of text per card
- Use consistent icon system for quick recognition
- Maintain white space for readability
- Avoid overwhelming with too many details

### 4. Action-Oriented Button Design
**What Works**:
- "Perfect for allowing the user to easily click from mobile"
- Clear call-to-action buttons for immediate next steps
- Direct integration with mapping and reservation systems
- Minimal friction between discovery and action

**Button Guidelines**:
- Primary actions (directions, reservations) should be visually prominent
- Secondary actions (website, phone) can be smaller but accessible
- Use familiar icons (map pin, calendar, phone, link)
- Ensure buttons work reliably across different mobile browsers

### 5. Context-Aware Time Intelligence
**What Works**:
- "Surface the most relevant results to the target user in a way that's context-aware time-wise"
- Real-time status updates based on current time
- "Starting soon" alerts for upcoming opportunities
- Automatic filtering reduces decision fatigue

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Live time calculation for all restaurant status
- Proactive notifications for time-sensitive opportunities
- Clear indicators for time until next happy hour
- Timezone awareness for accurate local time display

## Design Standards

### Color Palette
- **Active/Open**: Green (#28a745) - immediate availability
- **Starting Soon**: Orange (#fd7e14) - upcoming opportunity  
- **Inactive/Closed**: Gray (#6c757d) - unavailable
- **Background**: Dark theme optimized for evening use
- **Text**: High contrast for mobile readability

### Typography
- **Headers**: Clear, readable sans-serif
- **Body text**: Minimum 16px for mobile readability
- **Price indicators**: Consistent formatting ($$-$$$)
- **Status text**: Bold for quick scanning

### Layout Principles
- **Grid system**: Responsive cards with consistent spacing
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px for reliable mobile interaction
- **Information hierarchy**: Most important content first
- **Progressive disclosure**: Additional details available on demand

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Information Overload
- **Don't**: Include every possible detail on main cards
- **Do**: Provide essential info with option to drill down

### Generic Mobile Design
- **Don't**: Assume desktop-first responsive design is sufficient
- **Do**: Design specifically for mobile use cases and contexts

### Static Time Display
- **Don't**: Show fixed happy hour times without current context
- **Do**: Always indicate current relevance and time remaining

### Complex Navigation
- **Don't**: Require multiple taps to find relevant information
- **Do**: Surface most relevant content immediately with minimal filtering

## Future Enhancement Guidelines

### Maintain Core Strengths
1. **Simplicity**: Every new feature should maintain the "simple and intuitive" navigation
2. **Mobile-first**: Always design for mobile viewport first
3. **Context-awareness**: New features should enhance time-based relevance
4. **Action-oriented**: Maintain clear path from discovery to action

### Scalability Considerations
- Card design should accommodate additional restaurants without cluttering
- Filter system should scale to handle more complex criteria
- Status system should support additional states (reservations required, etc.)
- Action buttons should accommodate new integrations (delivery, social sharing)

### User Testing Priorities
- **Mobile usability**: Test on actual devices in real-world conditions
- **Filter effectiveness**: Measure how quickly users find relevant results
- **Action completion**: Track success rate for directions/reservations
- **Load performance**: Ensure fast loading for impatient mobile users

## Success Metrics

### Usability
- Time to find relevant restaurant: < 30 seconds
- Mobile tap accuracy: > 95% on first attempt
- Filter usage: > 70% of sessions use status filtering
- Action completion: > 60% click through to directions/reservations

### Design Quality
- Visual hierarchy clarity: Users identify status within 3 seconds
- Information sufficiency: < 10% need to visit external site for basic info
- Mobile satisfaction: > 4.5/5 rating for mobile experience
- Load performance: < 3 seconds initial render on mobile
