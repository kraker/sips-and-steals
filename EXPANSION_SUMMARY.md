## üöÄ Demo Enhancement

### **Created Deliverables**:

## üí° Strategic Value

This expansion positions the project as:
- **Comprehensive downtown guide** vs. neighborhood demo
- **Complete geographic coverage** of Denver's walkable core
- **Target user alignment** with urban professionals and sophisticated diners
- **Scalable architecture** demonstrated for future expansion to suburbs

The infrastructure is ready - we just need to run the full discovery/extraction pipeline on the expanded dataset to activate all 70 restaurants with live deal data.
