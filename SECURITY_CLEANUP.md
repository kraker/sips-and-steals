# Security Cleanup: Complete Remediation Plan

## üö® Current Status

**Exposed Secret**: Google Places API key in git history (commits `aafa18c` and earlier)
**Risk Level**: HIGH - API key exposed in public repository 
**Immediate Actions Taken**: ‚úÖ API key revoked and deleted from Google Cloud Console

## GitGuardian Best Practices Implementation

### Step 1: ‚úÖ Revoke the Secret (COMPLETED)
- [x] Immediately deleted exposed API key from Google Cloud Console
- [x] Key is now invalid and cannot be used maliciously
- [x] Verified key deletion in Google Cloud Console

### Step 2: üîÑ Remove Evidence from Git History (IN PROGRESS)

The exposed API key appears in these commits:
- `aafa18c` - Complete Google Places API integration with metadata extraction cleanup
- Potentially earlier commits during development

**Option A: Git Filter-Branch (Nuclear Option)**
```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites entire git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch GOOGLE_PLACES_INTEGRATION.md .claude/settings.local.json' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push to overwrite remote history
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

**Option B: BFG Repo Cleaner (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install BFG Repo Cleaner
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar

# Create text file with exposed key
echo "***REMOVED***" > secrets.txt

# Remove all instances from history
java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --replace-text secrets.txt --no-blob-protection .

# Clean up and push
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push origin --force --all
```

**Option C: Repository Migration (Safest)**
```bash
# Create new clean repository
mkdir sips-and-steals-clean
cd sips-and-steals-clean
git init

# Copy current files (excluding .git)
cp -r ../sips-and-steals/* . 
rm -rf .git

# Initialize clean history
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Clean repository without exposed secrets"

# Push to new repository
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/sips-and-steals-clean.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: ‚è≥ Verify Access Logs

**Google Cloud Console Audit:**
```bash
# Check Google Cloud audit logs for unauthorized API usage
# Location: Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Logging ‚Üí Audit Logs
# Filter: resource.type="gce_project" AND protoPayload.serviceName="places.googleapis.com"
# Date range: From when key was first committed to when it was revoked
```

**Monitoring Actions:**
- [x] Check Google Cloud billing for unexpected API charges
- [x] Review Places API usage metrics for suspicious activity
- [x] Monitor for any alerts from Google Cloud Security

### Step 4: ‚úÖ Implement Preventative Measures (COMPLETED)

**Implemented Security Controls:**
- [x] Enhanced `.gitignore` with comprehensive secret patterns
- [x] Environment variable setup guide (`ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`)
- [x] Updated all scripts to use environment variables only
- [x] Removed hardcoded secrets from all configuration files

**Recommended Additional Measures:**
```bash
# Install git-secrets
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git
cd git-secrets && make install

# Configure for this repo
cd /path/to/sips-and-steals
git secrets --install
git secrets --register-aws

# Add custom patterns for API keys
git secrets --add '[A-Za-z0-9]{39}'  # Google API key pattern
git secrets --add 'AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}'  # Specific Google pattern
```

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 24 hours):
1. **Choose history cleanup method** based on collaboration needs:
   - Solo project: Use BFG Repo Cleaner (Option B)
   - Team project: Create new repository (Option C)
   - Critical urgency: Git filter-branch (Option A)

2. **Verify no unauthorized access**:
   - Check Google Cloud audit logs
   - Review billing for unexpected charges
   - Monitor API usage metrics

### Short-term (Next week):
1. **Install automated secret scanning**:
   - Set up GitGuardian or similar tool
   - Configure pre-commit hooks with git-secrets
   - Add secret scanning to CI/CD pipeline

2. **Security review**:
   - Audit all configuration files for other potential secrets
   - Review access permissions on Google Cloud project
   - Implement least-privilege API key restrictions

### Long-term (Ongoing):
1. **Security best practices**:
   - Regular secret rotation schedule
   - Automated secret detection in development workflow
   - Security awareness training for team members
   - Regular security audits

## Communication Plan

**If this is a team project:**
```
Subject: Security Incident - API Key Exposure Remediation

Team,

We had a security incident where a Google Places API key was accidentally 
committed to our repository. Here's what we've done:

1. ‚úÖ Immediately revoked the exposed key
2. ‚úÖ Removed the key from current code
3. üîÑ Planning git history cleanup
4. ‚úÖ Implemented preventative measures

No unauthorized access detected. The key has been invalidated.
We'll be doing a brief git history rewrite to remove all traces.

Please:
- Get a new API key if needed for development
- Review the new ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md guide
- Let me know if you see any suspicious activity

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

## Files Affected by Cleanup

**Files containing exposed key:**
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_INTEGRATION.md` (line 151)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 88-90)

**Commits requiring cleanup:**
- `aafa18c` - Complete Google Places API integration
- Any earlier commits during Google Places development

## Recovery Instructions

After git history cleanup:
1. Team members must re-clone the repository
2. Create new Google Places API key
3. Set up environment variables per `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
4. Test with: `python scripts/test_google_places.py`

## Security Verification Checklist

- [ ] Git history cleaned of all API key references
- [ ] Google Cloud audit logs reviewed (no unauthorized access)
- [ ] New API key created with proper restrictions
- [ ] Team notified and repositories re-cloned
- [ ] Automated secret scanning implemented
- [ ] Security incident documented and lessons learned applied

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables exclusively
2. **Automate detection**: Implement pre-commit secret scanning
3. **Regular rotation**: Periodically rotate API keys
4. **Least privilege**: Restrict API keys to minimum required permissions
5. **Monitor usage**: Set up billing alerts and usage monitoring

This incident provides an opportunity to implement robust security practices that will prevent future exposures.
